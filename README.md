## What Is Time Travel?

It is is a concept that involves moving between different points in time,
either backward or forward. In theory, time travel would allow someone to
travel to the past and interact with historical events or to travel to the
future and see what will happen. While time travel has been a popular topic
in science fiction literature and films, it remains a theoretical concept
and has not been proven to be possible according to our current understanding
of physics.

## Theoritical Foundation

The theoretical foundation of time travel primarily stems from Einstein's
theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space and time.
There are two main components of Einstein's theory that are relevant to time
travel:

1. **Special Theory of Relativity**: Proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905, one
   of the key principles of the special theory of relativity is that the laws of
   physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each
   other. This theory introduced the concept of time dilation, which suggests that
   time can appear to pass at different rates for observers who are moving
   relative to each other. According to special relativity, as an object
   approaches the speed of light, time slows down relative to observers who are
   stationary.

2. **General Theory of Relativity**: Proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915,
   the general theory of relativity extends the principles of special relativity
   to include gravity. According to the general theory of relativity, gravity is
   not a force but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
   This theory predicts the existence of phenomena such as gravitational time
   dilation, where time appears to pass more slowly in regions of strong
   gravitational fields.

## Is Time Travel Really Possible?

According to our current understanding of physics, time travel remains a
theoretical concept and has not been proven to be possible. While there are
intriguing ideas and speculative theories within the realm of theoretical
physics, such as wormholes, closed timelike curves, and time dilation, there
is no experimental evidence or practical means to achieve time travel at this
time.

Einstein's theory of relativity suggests that time can be affected by factors
such as gravity and velocity, leading to phenomena like time dilation where
time appears to move slower in certain conditions. However, while these
concepts have been verified through experiments and observations, they do not
provide a practical method for traveling backward or forward in time as
commonly depicted in science fiction.

While scientists continue to explore the theoretical possibility of time
travel and its implications within the framework of modern physics, significant
technological and theoretical challenges remain to be overcome before time
travel could become a reality, if it is indeed possible at all.

## TLDR;

So, this repository was made to improve my vanity metrics. And yeah, thanks
for stopping by!
